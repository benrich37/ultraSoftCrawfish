# ultraSoftCrawfish
Repo for example usage of pCOHP with JDFTx. Please note, this repo will not be maintained, as future iterations of these
scripts will be written for usage in QimPy. These scripts should only be used for pCOHP analysis of JDFTx calculations
which use ultra-soft psuedopotentials. If this is not the case for your application, please use (link to lobster) instead.
